                <h2>Phyton App</h2>
                <p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes.
                    It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. 
                   It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++.Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
                   Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.</p>

                <h3>NodeJS App</h3>
                <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
                     Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
                    Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. 
                    Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.
                    Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. 
                    These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

                <h4>JQuery</h4>
                <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax. 
                    It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of August 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 10 million most popular websites. Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, 
                    having at least three to four times more usage than any other JavaScript library.
                    jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications.
                     jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. 
                    This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.

                <h5>CSS</h5>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
                    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, 
                    since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
                    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
                    which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                     CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
